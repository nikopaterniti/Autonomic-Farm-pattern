To run the project make sure to add the fast flow folder in project directory (es:SPM_PRJ/fastflow/ff)

-execute the makefile to produce farm.out and farm-ff.out

-for the native farm ./Run.sh
-for the FastFlow implementation FastFlowRun.sh

It will produce many csv files whose plots are shown in the report.

Thank you for the attention.
